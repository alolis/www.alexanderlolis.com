We are facing an unprecedented situation in human history. The COVID-19 virus has affected everyones life and is testing us in ways that we have not been tested before. It has been brutally attacking our health and our economies and imprisoned us in our own homes for our own safety but we need to be patient and go through this together.

Stay safe, be kind to each other and help those that need it.
