Lot's of interesting information and ideas, and even though I am sceptical about some, the fact that it does give an interesting perspective to human history is definitely intriguing and worth the read. The central idea around the book is that the humans did a huge mistake by turning from from being hunter-gatherers to agriculture which made them settle down, lose important knowledge and skills that all anchestors posesed and made us more miserable and harsh.

Jeremy Jones is definitely a master in snowboarding and mounteneering and I was anxious to read his book. I really, really wanted to love it but I am afraid, it failed short to my expectations. First of all, there are a lot of story sections which due to the chosen font and background, are either very hard to read or compltely unreadable. Secondly, I was expecting to gain some deep knowledge which someone can only gain by doing it, and even though Jeremy Jones has been out there for a long time and have gained years and years of experience, he has failed to transfer at least some of it. Although there are tips and technical notes in the book here and there, in general it felt a little bit vague.
