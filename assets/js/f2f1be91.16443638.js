around it. Although most of the concepts were known to me this is the first time that I felt everything coming together and got plenty of "Aha!" moments. I must admit, that a couple of chapters got too deep technically and I\'ve only read them without trying to fully understand them, but they were definitely worth going through them.

I strongly recommend reading it"),(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"[4/5]"," Refactoring UI"),": This book is not only for designers, but for developer as well. In fact, I would probably say that a developer needs to read this more than a designer. It definitely gives an interesting pespective on design and how to keep things clean and simple, to get things going instead of losing yourself into too much details. I strongly recommend reading it"),(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"[4/5]"," The Goal"),": A very well written process improvement novel. The story was very realistic  with practical lessons that can be applied to the real world. For me, an important lesson here was that open-minded teams which want to solve problems and improve, will find the way by communicating well and by being willing to go through an iterative process. The story will probably be more interesting to people that are in the manufacturing industry but in general I find it useful for anyone that deals with process flows.

Two things really hit me when I was reading this book. The first one is the way the book phrases the fact that our brain can create reality and that we live in a made up world. The second one, which it's the first time I read about it although it seems it is known in this circle for some time now, is that we do not have a triune brain in which we can blame our primitive behavior when e.g get angry, but we simple have a differently evolved brain from other species and our irational thoughts can simple be attributed to body budgeting reasons. A very interesting idea that if accepted world wide, it will affect society at it's core, especially in law cases.

I feel that the Elixir sections could have been more compact in order to make you read an Elixir-specific book that covers the subject better and maybe write more about of Phoenix, but I definitely didn't mind.

Lot's of real world examples and practical ideas. Some sections were a little bit more dense and more tiring than others but definitely worth the trouble reading them.

A junior developer however, will not, but some of the advice in here might not be understood until the developer actually experiences it in a real code base.
